  # SLEEP APNEA PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOMES STUDY
  ## CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN A RESEARCH STUDY

  ### Study Title: Module 1: The Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Network (also known as MyApnea.Org)

  The Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Network (SAPCON) is a medical research study conducted across the U.S., supported by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The study is being led by groups of doctors, patients and other stakeholders working together.  Dr. Susan Redline from Brigham and Women’s Hospital is the study Principal Investigator. She and SAPCON staff are available to answer any questions you may have.

  Research studies include only people who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision about participating, and discuss your decision with your family or friends if you wish. If you have any questions, you may ask the researchers.

  1.    **Why is this study being done?**

        The purpose of the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcome Network is to actively engage people with sleep apnea, or who have a family member with the condition, to share health information needed for research that will improve the health and well-being of adults and children with sleep apnea.

  2.    **How many people will take part in this study?**

        We hope to enroll at least 50,000 people into the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Network.

  3.    **Am I eligible to participate in the study?**

        To participate, you need to be an individual who has been diagnosed with sleep apnea, or be a family member of a patient with diagnosed sleep apnea.

  4.    **What will happen if I take part in this research study?**

        *Surveys*

        If you agree to participate in the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Network, you will be asked to complete a series of surveys about your sleep, symptoms and health. The surveys will ask about such things as when you were diagnosed with sleep apnea, treatments you have used, medical illnesses such as high blood pressure, and your energy level. The basic surveys will take less than one hour to complete for most people.
        You will be asked to update information on these surveys every 2 to 6 months or as your health changes.
        Information collected about you will be combined with information from other patients in the Network to describe the health outcomes being studied by SAPCON. Other patients and researchers will be able to view graphs and summary information on groups of patients. When combining this information, your name and other personal information *will not* be used.

        *Other study activities*

        As a SAPCON participant, you may be invited to participate in additional study activities, or “modules” of the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study. Each of these modules has a separate consent form and will be explained in detail so you may determine if you would like to be a part of it. Participation in these additional study modules will be optional. That is, you can still be a Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes study participant without participating.

        *Reminders and study communications*

        When there is a study activity that we want you to complete or consider, we will contact you. We plan to update your health status every 2 to 6 months. The study will offer a variety of communication options that you can choose from.

  5.    **How long will I be in the study?**

        We would like to keep track of your health status for  at least 2 years, and possibly longer so we know how your health changes over time. Keeping in touch with you and checking on your health periodically over many years is very important to help us look at the long-term effects of sleep apnea and its treatments on health. We plan to do this by contacting you at least twice a year.

  6.    **Can I stop being in the study?**

        Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. We won’t delete the information about you that we’ve already collected, but we will stop collecting any new information about you and will stop contacting you.

        To stop participating in the study, please send an email to the study staff at <support@myapnea.org>.

  7.    **What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?**

        Although we will do our best to protect your study information (see below), there is still a very small risk of loss of privacy. There is a risk that participating in the study will make you want to access the healthcare system more often, and that costs money. For example, the feedback information that we provide to you (see ‘Benefits’) might make you want to talk to your healthcare provider, or you may want to make extra visits to your provider in order to fill out a survey. While there may often be benefits to you from seeing your healthcare provider, there are also costs, and the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study will not pay for any part of your medical care. You should not see your healthcare provider solely for the purpose of collecting data for the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study.

        For more information about risks and side effects, ask one of the researchers.

  8.    **Are there benefits to taking part in the study?**

        You will not obtain any direct health benefits from participating in the study, but you will receive information on healthy sleep and healthy lifestyle information and sleep apnea news updates. You also will be provided feedback information on topics such as your sleepiness and sleep patterns that are based on the information you provide throughout the study. We hope that by participating you will help us contribute to a better understanding of sleep apnea that will lead to improved health outcomes for the millions of patients with sleep apnea.

  9.    **Will I get advice about my health from the study?**

        No. We will provide you with information about symptoms of untreated sleep apnea and available sleep apnea treatments but we will not provide you with specific advice, even if the information you provide us is very abnormal. The health information that we provide to you, including that shared by other patients,  does not in any way substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment that your doctor or other healthcare provider may give you. Always ask the advice of your healthcare provider if you have any questions about a medical condition. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking care because of something you have read as part of this study. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor or dial 911 immediately.

  10.   **What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?**

        You are free to choose not to participate in the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Network.  If you decide not to take part, there will be no penalty to you.

  11.   **How is my information protected?**

        We will do our best to make sure that the personal information we collect about you is kept private and secure. **The Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study will never sell, rent, or lease your contact information.** If information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your name and other personal information will not be used. However, we cannot guarantee total privacy — your personal information may be given out if required by law (e.g., to prevent possible injury to yourself or others).

        Your information will be transmitted and stored using very secure systems. The network servers where your data are stored sit behind firewalls that do not allow unauthorized access and are physically located in a secure server room that can only be accessed by critical staff members.

        For details please see our Privacy Policy and Data Security Measures, attached at the end of this consent form.

        You will not be charged for **any** aspect of participating in the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network.

  13.   **Will I be paid for taking part in this study?**

        You will not be paid for taking part in the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network.

  14.   **What are my rights if I take part in this study?**

        Taking part in this study is your choice. You may choose either to take part or not to take part in the study. If you decide to take part in this study, you may leave the study at any time. No matter what decision you make, there will be no penalty to you.

        We will tell you about new information or changes in the study that may affect your willingness to continue in the study.

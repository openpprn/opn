privacy_policy: |
    There are many safeguards in place to protect your privacy.  In general, health information that identifies you is private under federal law.  However, you should know that in addition to Partners researchers the following people or groups may be able to see, use, and share your identifiable health information from the research and why they may need to do so:

    - Any sponsor(s) of SAPCON and the people or groups it hires to help with the SAPCON
    - The Partners ethics board that oversees the project and the Partners research quality improvement programs
    - People from organizations that provide independent accreditation and oversight of hospitals and research
    - People or organizations that we hire to do work for us, such as data storage companies, insurers, and lawyers
    - Federal and state agencies that oversee or review research, such as the Patient Centered Outcomes Network.

    *We will use your information for research:* We collect information about your identity, your health, and some of your behaviors that might help us predict your future health. This information will be used in research analyses and results of these analyses will be will be presented in scientific conferences and published. These presentations and publications will never show any information that identifies you or any other individual in the study. We will share summary information that does not contain any identifying information with other participants in the network, which include members of the National Patient Centered Outcomes Network and research partners in MyApnea.Org.

    We will never sell, rent, or lease your information.

    We will never voluntarily share identifying information about you without your permission.

    *You will be able to see some of your study information:* When you registered for the study, you provided us with a username and a password. You can use this to sign into the study and see your Dashboard and some of the health information you’ve provided to us (e.g., your sleep surveys and health profile). You should be very careful not to provide your login information to anyone else, or they could sign in as you and be able to see that same health information. If you are worried that someone else may be using your login information, please let us know immediately, or change your password yourself through the Participant Homepage.

    *Electronic Security and Adherence to the HIPAA Privacy Rule:* Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study follows the security guidelines of the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). All study data is transmitted, stored, and processed in a secure environment.

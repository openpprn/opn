        Sleep apnea is a common and potentially life-threatening sleep and breathing disorder that affects millions of people like us.  Left untreated, sleep apnea increases the risk for high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke and other serious medical conditions.  Although there are several treatments for sleep apnea, there is a lot that is not known about what treatments work best for which people.

          My wife told me I stopped breathing while I slept….a lot!  She lost sleep thinking that I would die and our lives were severely impacted by it.  Thankfully, she read an article on sleep apnea and made me go to the doctor.  I don’t want other people to suffer needlessly from this condition.

          My husband suffered for 25 years with sleep apnea before being diagnosed.  It affected his life and career.  We are convinced that his father died as a result of having it.  And our daughter was also diagnosed at the age of 3.  I want other parents to realize that sleep apnea can run in families and kids suffer from this condition too.

          I have always snored, loud…I had no idea it was more than just a nuisance to my wife and family.  My son had been trying to be me to see a doctor for years, but it wasn’t until he asked me one Christmas if I planned on seeing his children grow up that I took it seriously.  I have lowered my blood pressure and my chances of heart disease by getting treated and even take my CPAP with me on overnight motorcycle trips.  I want to be a part of this network and help research new treatment options.
